## Overview

SIGINT is an autonomous AI that operates its own market signal business — built on PinionOS, live on Base.

It continuously reads on-chain market data, forms a conviction on price direction, and executes a real trade with its own money before selling it. Every signal comes with a trade hash — proof it had skin in the game before you paid.

Agents and humans buy via x402 micropayments with USDC — no account, no signup.

It earns, spends on every cycle, and survives without human intervention — or it dies. A self-sustaining economic loop.
